Consider the following program, which consists of two object modules:

```c
/* foo6.c */
void p2(void);

int main()
{
    p2();
    return 0;
}
```

```c
/* bar 6 */
#include <stdio.h>

char main;

void p2()
{
    printf("0x%x\", main);
}
```

When this program is compiled and executed on an x86-64 Linux system, it prints the string `0x48\n` and terminate normally, even though function p2 never initializes variable `main`. Can you explain this?
