Performing the following tasks will help you become more familiar with the various tools for manipulating object files.

### A
How many object files are contained in the versions of `libc.a` and `libm.a` on your system?

### B
Does `gcc -Og` produce different executable code than `-Og -g`?

### C.
What shared libraries does the GCC driver on your system use?

## Answer

### A
By invoking `ar -t` it outputs the list of object files contained in the static library.

On my system, `libc.a` includes 1676 object files, and `libm.a` includes 745 object files.

### B
No, they have the same executable code. The only difference between them is the production of `gcc -Og -g` contains debug sections.

### C
By invoking `ldd` we can see the libraries the executable file depends on.

On my system, the GCC use `linux-vdso.so.1`, `libm.so.6`, `libc.so.6`, and`ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` for interpreter.
