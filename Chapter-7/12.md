Consider the call to function `swap` in object file `m.o` (Problem 7.6).

```
9:      e8 00 00 00 00          callq  e <main+0xe>     swap
```

with the following relocation entry:

```
r.offset = 0xa
r.symbol = swap
r.type   = R_X86_64_PC32
r.addend = -4
```

### A
Suppose that the linker relocates `.text` in `m.o` to address `0x4004e0` and `swap` to address `0x4004f8`. Then what is the value of the relocated reference to `swap` in the `callq` instruction?

### B
Suppose that the linker relocates `.text` in `m.o` to address `0x4004d0` and `swap` to address `0x400500`. Then what is the value of the relocated reference to `swap` in the `callq` instruction?

## Answer

### A
0a 00 00 00

### B
22 00 00 00
