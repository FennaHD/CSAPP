Intel-compatible processors also support an "extended-precision" floating-point format with an 80-bit word divided into a sign bit, k = 15 exponent bits, a single *integer* bit, and n = 63 fraction bits. The integer bit is an explicit copy of the implied bit in the IEEE floating-point representation. That is, it equals 1 for normalized values and 0 for denormalized values. Fill in the following table giving the approximate value of some "interesting" numbers in this format:

| Description                    | Value | Decimal |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Smallest positive denormalized |       |         |
| Smallest positive normalized   |       |         |
| Largest normalized             |       |         |


## Answer

| Description                    | Value                    | Decimal               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Smallest positive denormalized | `0x00000000000000000001` | 2 ^ -16445            |
| Smallest positive normalized   | `0x00018000000000000000` | 2 ^ -16382            |
| Largest normalized             | `0x7ffeffffffffffffffff` | 2 ^ 16384 - 2 ^ 16320 |
