Consider the following two 9-bit floating-point representation based on the IEEE floating-point format.

1. Format A
  * There is 1 sign bit.
  * There are *k* = 5 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 15.
  * There are *n* = 3 fraction bits.
2. Format B
  * There is 1 sign bit.
  * There are *k* = 4 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 7.
  * There are *n* = 4 fraction bits.

In the following table, you are given some bit patterns in format A, and your task is to convert them to closest value in format B. If rounding is neccessary you should *round toward* +∞. In addition, give the values of numbers given by the format A and format B bit patterns. Give these as whole numbers (e.g., 17) or as fractions (e.g., 17/64 or 17/2^6).
