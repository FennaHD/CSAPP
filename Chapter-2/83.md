Consider numbers having a binary representation consisting of an infinite string of the form 0.yyyyyy..., where y is a k-bit sequence. For example, the binary representation of 1/3 is 0.01010101...(y=01), while the representation of 1/5 is 0.00110011...(y=0011).

 A. Let Y = `B2U_k(y)`, that is the number having binary representation y. Give a formula in terms of Y and k for the value represented by the infinite string.  
Hint: Consider the effect of shifting the binary point k positions to the right.
 B. What is the numeric value of the string for the following values of y?  
    (a) 101  
    (b) 0110  
    (c) 010011
