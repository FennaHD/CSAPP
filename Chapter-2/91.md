Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes proved that 233/71 < π < 22/7. Had he had access to a computer and the standard library \<math.h\>, he would have been able to determine that the single-precision floating-point approximation of π has the hexadecimal representation 0x40490FDB. Of course, all of these are just approximations, since π is not retional.

### A.
What is the fractional binary number denoted by this floating-point value?

### B.
What is the fractional binary representation of 22/7? Hint: See Problem 2.83.

### C.
At what bit position (relative to the binary point) do these approximations to π diverge?

## Answer

### A.
1.10010010000111111011011

### B.
1.10010010010010010010010

### C.
10
