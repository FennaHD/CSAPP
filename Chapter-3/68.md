In the following code, *A* and *B* are constants defined with `#define`:

```c
typedef struct {
    int x[A][B]; /* Unknown constants A and B */
    long y;
} str1;

typedef struct {
    char array[B];
    int t;
    short s[A];
    long u;
} str2;

void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q) {
    long v1 = q->t;
    long v2 = q->u;
    p->y = v1+v2;
}
```

GCC generates the following code for `setVal`:

```asm
# void setVal(str1 *p, str2 *q)
# p in %rdi, q in %rsi
setVal:
  movslq  8(%rsi), %rax
  addq    32(%rsi), %rax
  movq    %rax, 184(%rdi)
  ret
```

What are the values of *A* and *B*? (The solution is unique.)

## Answer
According to the assembly code, we know that the offset of str2.t is 8, and str2.u 32, by which we can calculate the range of *A* is 5..8, *B* 7..10.

The same as str1.y, of which the offset is 184. So the result of *A*\**B* should locates in 45..46.

So the only one possible result is 

```c
#define A (5)
#define B (9)
```
