ISO C99 includes extensions to support complex numbers. Any floating-point type can be modified with the keyword `complex`. Here are some sample functions that work with complex data and that call some of the associated library functions:

```c
#include <complex.h>

double c_imag(double complex x) {
    return cimag(x);
}

double c_real(double complex x) {
    return creal(x);
}

double complex c_sub(double complex x, double complex y) {
    return x - y;
}
```

When compiled, GCC generates the following assembly code for these functions:

```asm
# double c_imag(double complex x)
c_imag:
  movapd  %xmm1, %xmm0
  ret

# double c_real(double complex x)
c_real:
  rep; ret

# double complex c_sub(double complex x, double complex y)
c_sub:
  subsd   %xmm2, %xmm0
  subsd   %xmm3, %xmm1
  ret
```

Based on these examples, determine the following:

### A.
How are complex arguments passed to a function?

### B.
How are complex values returned fro a function?

## Answer

### A.
One complex value is saved in two xmm register, The real part of first argument is passed through %xmm0 and imag part %xmm1, second %mm2 and %xmm3, etc.

### B.
The real part of return value is saved at %xmm0, imag part %xmm1.
