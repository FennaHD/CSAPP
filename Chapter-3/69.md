You are charged with maintaining a large C program, and you come across the following code:

```c
typedef struct {
    int first;
    a_struct a[CNT];
    int last;
} b_struct;

void test(long i, b_struct *bp)
{
    int n = bp->first + bp->last;
    a_struct *ap = &bp->a[i];
    ap->x[ap->idx] = n;
}
```

The declarations of the compile-time constant `CNT` and the structure `a_struct` are in file for which you do not have the necessary access privilege. Fortunately, you have a copy of the `.o` version of code, which you are able to disassemble with the `OBJDUMP` program, yielding the following disassembly:

```asm
# void test(long i, b_struct *bp)
# i in %rdi, bp in %rsi
0000000000000000 <test>
   0:   8b 8e 20 01 00 00        mov    0x120(%rsi),%ecx
   6:   03 0e                    add    (%rsi),%ecx
   8:   48 8d 04 bf              lea    (%rdi,%rdi,4),%rax
   c:   48 8d 04 c6              lea    (%rsi,%rax,8),%rax
  10:   48 8b 50 08              mov    0x8(%rax),%rdx
  14:   48 63 c9                 mvoslq %ecx,%rcx
  17:   48 89 4c d0 10           mov    %rcx,0x10(%rax,%rdx,8)
  1c:   c3                       retq
```

Using your reverse engineering skills, deduce the following:

### A.
The value of `CNT`.

### B.
A complete declaration of structure `a_struct`. Assume that the only fileds in this structure are `idx` ad x, and that both of these contain signed values.

## Answer

### A.
According to

```asm
lea (%rdi,%rdi,4),%rax
lea (%rsi,%rax,8),%rax
mov 0x8(%rax),%rdx
```

The expression `&bp->a[i]` is equal to `bp + i * 5 * 8 + 8`. It means the width of `a_struct` is 40.
So `CNT` is the difference of offset of `&b_struct.last` and `&b_struct.a` divide 40, which is 7 exactly.

### B.
The `ap->idx` should be saved at `%rdx` after `mov 0x8(%rax),%rdx`. so `0x10(%rax,%rdx,8)` is the address of `ap->x[ap->idx]`, and the offset of `a_struct.x` is 8. So

```c
typedef struct {
    long idx;
    long x[4];
} a_struct;
```
