Consider the following union declaration:

```c
union ele {
    struct {
        long *p;
        long y;
    } e1;
    struct {
        long x;
        union ele *next;
    } e2;
};
```

This declaration illustrates that structures can be embedded within unions.

The following function (with some expressions omitted) operates on a linked list having these unions as list elements:

```c
void proc (union ele *up) {
    up->_________ = *(_________) - _________;
}
```

### A.
What are the offsets (in bytes) of the following fields:

```text
    e1.p       _________
    e1.y       _________
    e2.x       _________
    e2.next    _________
```

### B.
How many total bytes does the structure require?

### C.
The compiler generates the following assembly code for `proc`:

```asm
# void proc(union ele *up)
# up in %rdi
proc:
  movq    8(%rdi), %rax
  movq    (%rax), %rdx
  movq    (%rdx), %rdx
  subq    8(%rax), %rdx
  movq    %rdx, (%rdi)
  ret
```

On the basis of this information, fill in the missing expressions in the code for `proc`. *Hint:* Some union references can have ambiguous interpretations. These ambiguities get resolved as you see where the referencs lead. There is only one answer that does not perform any casting and does not violate any type constaints.

## Answer

### A.
```text
    e1.p       0
    e1.x       8
    e2.y       0
    e2.next    8
```

### B.
16

### C.
```c
void proc(union ele *up) {
    up->e2.x = *(up->e2.next->e1.p) - up->e1.y;
}
```
