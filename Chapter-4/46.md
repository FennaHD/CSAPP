In Section 3.4.2, the x86-64 `popq` instruction was described as copying the result from the top of the stack to the destination register and then incrementing the stack pointer. So, if we had an instruction of the form `popq` *REG*, it would be equivalent to the code sequence

```asm
movq (%rsp), REG
addq $8, %rsp
```

### A.
In light of analysis done in Practice Problem 4.8, does this code sequence
correctly describe the behavior of the instruction `popq %rsp`? Explain.

### B.
How could you rewrite the code sequence so that it correctly describes both the cases where *REG* is `%rsp` as well as any other register?

## Answer

### A.
No, if so, there will not be problem B.


### B.
```asm
addq $8, %rsp
movq 8(%rsp), REG
```
