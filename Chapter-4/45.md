In Section 3.4.2, the x86-64 `pushq` instruction was described as decrementing the stack pointer and then storing the register at the stack pointer location. So, if we had an instruction of the form `pushq REG`, for some register *REG*, it would be equivalent to the code sequence

```asm
subq $8,%rsp
movq REG, (%rsp)
```

### A.
In light of analysis done in Practice Problem Problem 4.7, does this code sequence correctly describe the behavior of the instruction `pushq %rsp`? Explain.

### B.
How could you rewrite the code sequence so that it correctly describes both the cases where *REG* is `%rsp` as well as any other register?

## Answer

### A.
No, if so, there will not be problem B.

### B.
```asm
movq REG, -8(%rsp)
subq $8, %rsp
```
