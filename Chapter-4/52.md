# The file seq-full.hcl contains the HCL description for SEQ, along with the
# declaration of a constant IIADDQ having hexadecimal value C, the instruction
# code for iaddq. Modify the HCL descriptions of the control logic blocks to
# implement the iaddq instruction, as described in Practice Problem 4.3 and
# Problem 4.51. See the lab material for directions on how to generate a
# simulator for your solution and how to test it.
